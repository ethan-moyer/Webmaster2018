          <p class="">Today, we have A.I. that is used in a wide variety of fields, such as translation or data management. Currently, Googleâ€™s Neural Machine Network is used to accurately translate between languages. This A.I. was able to reduce errors by 60% when the text was read by a real human (Schuster 1). With this technology, it will become much easier to communicate between different languages. Google is also changing how advertisements are placed on the web. In February, 2018, Google started its new program called Auto Ads. The Auto Ads program uses machine learning to place relevant ads on websites and how many of them to place (Fingas 1). A.I. may be a relatively new technology today, but as technology progresses A.I. will be used for even more tasks than it is today. </p>

          <p class="">The pricing for using an A.I. changes depending on which service and which A.I. is being used. The pricing for the Google Cloud ML Engine changes depending on the type of the machine. The cheapest version is the Basic tier which costs $0.2774 per hour. The most expensive version is the Premium_1 tier which costs $24.1683 per hour. IBM Watson, an A.I. created for businesses has a similar tier system ranging from Lite to Professional. The Lite version is free and gives the user 5,000 A.I. predictions every month, and the Professional version costs $1,000 for each instance and the user gets 2,000 predictions.  </p>
